I created this visualization by first manipulating the data into finding the encounters where patients had Depression,
Anxiety, or PTSD. Then, I found out the dates of the first encounter to see which encounters followed the pattern 
Anxiety to Depression or Depression to PTSD. The visualization shows events where this pattern is followed. 
The one issue with this was actually getting symbols into tableau while also having issues with editing the legend. 

Claim
It is much more common for patients to have anxiety and then depression that is for them to have depression and then PTSD. 

Reason
There are many instances of patients having anxiety and later having depression, but only one instance of a patient having
depression and then PTSD
